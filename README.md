function call arguments type match
function return statement match type

TODO:
- Manage to make function declaration usefull, remove type param specification from function definition: TODO TEST
- Invent a better if statement
- Allow functions as function parameters in: function dec, body def, function call: TODO TEST

- Solve SET ambiguity with lists

- Abstract tree construction Execution.

Charateristics:
- Strong typed: no implicit conversions are made
- Static typed: type confilct at compile time
- Variables are constants
- Functional language inspired - makes strong use of recurision, costant vars
