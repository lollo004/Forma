# Forma
Forma is a functional statically typed programming language written for Compiler Construction exam project.

TODO-FUTURE:
function call arguments type match
function return statement match type

TODO:
- list[inum] is not considered an LTERM. but should be.

- Check if val2 is usefull not only in VDEC. Check general AST structure robustness
- Abstract tree construction Execution.

Charateristics:
- Strong typed: no implicit conversions are made
- Static typed: type confilct at compile time
- Variables are constants
- Functional language inspired - makes strong use of recurision, costant vars
